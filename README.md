# ISLRv2 solutions template

This repository provides a [bookdown] [GitHub template] for completing the end
of chapter "Conceptual" and "Applied" exercises from the the book [An
Introduction to Statistical Learning] by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor
Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

## tl;dr

* [Generate a new repository from this template].
* Fill in your answers in R Markdown between the commented questions.
* Push your edits to build your [bookdown book of solutions].

## Usage

To complete your solutions, please [generate a new repository] from this
 template this repository first. You can then add solutions between the relevant
commented questions using [`Rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

All questions from the original book have been translated to markdown and are
quoted. You should provide you answers between the commented sections. 
For example:


```md
> For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect
> the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or
> worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.
>
> a. The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is
>    small.

In this case, a flexible method would be better because we have a large number
of observations so can more reliably detect subtle patterns in the data without
risk of overfitting due to the low number of predictors.

> b. The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of
>    observations n is small.

Erm, perhaps the opposite?
```

You may want to edit this README (to reflect that your version is not a
template!), and edit the `edit` tag in `_output.yml` to point to your
repository.

## Data sets

For some questions, you are required to read in data. These data are provided
in subdirectory `data`, downloaded from the [resources] section of 
<https://www.statlearning.com>.


## Implementation details

This repository is setup using bookdown and can build a [gitbook] style bookdown
book. Options are controlled in `_bookdown.yml` and `_output.yml`. Notably, I've
set `new_session: yes` to start a new R session for each chapter of the book,
so R packages required for answers should be reloaded for each chapter
that requires them.

To build the book locally you can run:

```{r}
bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')
```

Or hit the "build" button in your RStudio session.

### GitHub workflow

I have specified a `.github/workflows` directory to implement a [GitHub
workflow] to build the book on updates to the repository and then host the 
built book from GitHub pages. For example, to see the built version of this 
template, see the [GitHub pages deployment]. When generating a new repository
from this template you may need to enable workflows to get this to run. The 
workflow will create a new branch `gh-pages` containing the built book and will
deploy this book for you.

### Dependencies

R package dependencies should be specified in the (fake) package `DESCRIPTION`
file. These dependencies will then be installed by the workflow so that your 
book build works as expected.

### Styling

I've added some (minimal) styling for the book inside `islrv2.css`, notably,
using [Computer Modern] in homage to the the book (and the rest of this fonts
history!). To achieve this, I've made use of a [web version] of computer modern.

## Final words

Many thanks for the original authors for a great book on statistical learning.
