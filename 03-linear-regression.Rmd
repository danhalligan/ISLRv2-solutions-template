# Linear Regression

## Conceptual

### Question 1

> Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4
> correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values.
> Your explanation should be phrased in terms of `sales`, `TV`, `radio`, and
> `newspaper`, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

### Question 2

> Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and KNN
> regression methods.

### Question 3

> Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, $X_1$ = GPA, $X_2$ = IQ,
> $X_3$ = Level (1 for College and 0 for High School), $X_4$ = Interaction
> between GPA and IQ, and $X_5$ = Interaction between GPA and Level. The
> response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars).
> Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get $\hat\beta_0 = 50$,
> $\hat\beta_1 = 20$, $\hat\beta_2 = 0.07$, $\hat\beta_3 = 35$, $\hat\beta_4 =
> 0.01$, $\hat\beta_5 = -10$.
>
> a. Which answer is correct, and why?
>     i. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn more on
>        average than college graduates.
>     ii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn more on
>         average than high school graduates.
>     iii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn more on
>          average than college graduates provided that the GPA is high enough.
>     iv. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn more on 
>         average than high school graduates provided that the GPA is high 
>         enough.
>
> b. Predict the salary of a college graduate with IQ of 110 and a GPA of 4.0.
>
> c. True or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction term is
>    very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction effect. Justify
>    your answer.

### Question 4

> I collect a set of data ($n = 100$ observations) containing a single predictor
> and a quantitative response. I then fit a linear regression model to the data,
> as well as a separate cubic regression, i.e. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X +
> \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \epsilon$.
>
> a. Suppose that the true relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is linear,
>    i.e. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$. Consider the training residual
>    sum of squares (RSS) for the linear regression, and also the training RSS
>    for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the other,
>    would we expect them to be the same, or is there not enough information to
>    tell? Justify your answer.
>
> b. Answer (a) using test rather than training RSS.
>
> c. Suppose that the true relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is not linear, but
>    we don't know how far it is from linear. Consider the training RSS for the
>    linear regression, and also the training RSS for the cubic regression.
>    Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would we expect them to be
>    the same, or is there not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.
>
> d. Answer (c) using test rather than training RSS.

### Question 5

> Consider the fitted values that result from performing linear regression
> without an intercept. In this setting, the ith fitted value takes the form
> $$\hat{y}_i = x_i\hat\beta,$$
> where
> $$\hat{\beta} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i\right) / \left(\sum_{i' = 1}^n x^2_{i'}\right).$$
> show that we can write
> $$\hat{y}_i = \sum_{i' = 1}^na_{i'}y_{i'}$$
> What is $a_{i'}$?
>
> _Note: We interpret this result by saying that the fitted
> values from linear regression are linear combinations of the response values._

### Question 6

> Using (3.4), argue that in the case of simple linear regression, the
> least squares line always passes through the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$.

### Question 7

> It is claimed in the text that in the case of simple linear regression
> of $Y$ onto $X$, the $R^2$ statistic (3.17) is equal to the square of the
> correlation between $X$ and $Y$ (3.18). Prove that this is the case. For
> simplicity, you may assume that $\bar{x} = \bar{y} = 0$.

## Applied

### Question 8

> This question involves the use of simple linear regression on the Auto
> data set.
>
> a. Use the `lm()` function to perform a simple linear regression with `mpg` as
>   the response and `horsepower` as the predictor. Use the `summary()` function
>   to print the results. Comment on the output. For example:
>   i. Is there a relationship between the predictor and the response?
>   ii. How strong is the relationship between the predictor and the response?
>   iii. Is the relationship between the predictor and the response positive or
>        negative?
>   iv. What is the predicted mpg associated with a horsepower of 98?
>   v. What are the associated 95% confidence and prediction intervals?
>
> b. Plot the response and the predictor. Use the `abline()` function to display
>   the least squares regression line.
>
> c. Use the `plot()` function to produce diagnostic plots of the least squares
>   regression fit. Comment on any problems you see with the fit.

### Question 9

> This question involves the use of multiple linear regression on the `Auto`
> data set.
>
> a. Produce a scatterplot matrix which includes all of the variables in the
>    data set.
>
> b. Compute the matrix of correlations between the variables using the function
>    `cor()`. You will need to exclude the name variable, `name` which is
>    qualitative.
>
> c. Use the `lm()` function to perform a multiple linear regression with `mpg`
>    as the response and all other variables except name as the predictors. Use 
>    the `summary()` function to print the results. Comment on the output. For
>    instance:
>    i. Is there a relationship between the predictors and the response?
>    ii. Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship
>       to the response?
>    iii. What does the coefficient for the `year` variable suggest?
>
> d. Use the `plot()` function to produce diagnostic plots of the linear
>    regression fit. Comment on any problems you see with the fit. Do the
>    residual plots suggest any unusually large outliers? Does the leverage plot
>    identify any observations with unusually high leverage?
>
> e. Use the `*` and `:` symbols to fit linear regression models with
>    interaction effects. Do any interactions appear to be statistically
>    significant?
>
> f. Try a few different transformations of the variables, such as $log(X)$,
>    $\sqrt{X}$, $X^2$. Comment on your findings.

### Question 10

> This question should be answered using the `Carseats` data set.
>
> a. Fit a multiple regression model to predict `Sales` using `Price`, `Urban`,
>    and `US`.
>
> b. Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be
>    careful---some of the variables in the model are qualitative!
>
> c. Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the
>    qualitative variables properly.
>
> d. For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis
>    $H_0 : \beta_j = 0$?
>
> e. On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model
>    that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association
>    with the outcome.
>
> f. How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?
>
> g. Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the
>    coefficient(s).
>
> h. Is there evidence of outliers or high leverage observations in the model
>    from (e)?

### Question 11

> In this problem we will investigate the t-statistic for the null hypothesis
> $H_0 : \beta = 0$ in simple linear regression without an intercept. To
> begin, we generate a predictor `x` and a response `y` as follows.
> ```r
> set.seed(1)
> x <- rnorm(100)
> y <- 2 * x + rnorm(100)
> ```
>
> a. Perform a simple linear regression of `y` onto `x`, without an intercept.
>    Report the coefficient estimate $\hat{\beta}$, the standard error of this
>    coefficient estimate, and the t-statistic and p-value associated with the
>    null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta = 0$. Comment on these results. (You can
>    perform regression without an intercept using the command `lm(y~x+0)`.)
>
> b. Now perform a simple linear regression of `x` onto `y` without an intercept,
>    and report the coefficient estimate, its standard error, and the
>    corresponding t-statistic and p-values associated with the null hypothesis
>    $H_0 : \beta = 0$. Comment on these results.
>
> c. What is the relationship between the results obtained in (a) and (b)?
>
> d. For the regression of $Y$ onto $X$ without an intercept, the
>    t-statistic for $H_0 : \beta = 0$ takes the form 
>    $\hat{\beta}/SE(\hat{\beta})$, where $\hat{\beta}$ is given by (3.38), and
>    where
>    $$
>    SE(\hat\beta) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - x_i\hat\beta)^2}{(n-1)\sum_{i'=1}^nx_{i'}^2}}.
>    $$
>    (These formulas are slightly different from those given in Sections 3.1.1 and
>    3.1.2, since here we are performing regression without an intercept.) Show
>    algebraically, and confirm numerically in R, that the t-statistic can be
>    written as
>    $$
>    \frac{(\sqrt{n-1}) \sum_{i-1}^nx_iy_i)}
>         {\sqrt{(\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2)(\sum_{i'=1}^ny_{i'}^2)-(\sum_{i'=1}^nx_{i'}y_{i'})^2}}
>    $$
>
> e. Using the results from (d), argue that the *t*-statistic for the
>    regression of y onto x is the same as the *t*-statistic for the regression
>    of `x` onto `y`.
>
> f. In `R`, show that when regression is performed *with* an intercept, the
>    $t$-statistic for $H_0 : \beta_1 = 0$ is the same for the regression of `y`
>    onto `x` as it is for the regression of `x` onto `y`.

### Question 12

> This problem involves simple linear regression without an intercept.
>
> a. Recall that the coefficient estimate $\hat{\beta}$ for the linear
>    regression of $Y$ onto $X$ without an intercept is given by (3.38). Under
>    what circumstance is the coefficient estimate for the regression of $X$
>    onto $Y$ the same as the coefficient estimate for the regression of $Y$
>    onto $X$?
>
> b. Generate an example in `R` with $n = 100$ observations in which the
>    coefficient estimate for the regression of $X$ onto $Y$ is different from
>    the coefficient estimate for the regression of $Y$ onto $X$.
>
> c. Generate an example in `R` with $n = 100$ observations in which the
>    coefficient estimate for the regression of $X$ onto $Y$ is the same as the
>    coefficient estimate for the regression of $Y$ onto $X$.

### Question 13

> In this exercise you will create some simulated data and will fit simple
> linear regression models to it. Make sure to use `set.seed(1)` prior to
> starting part (a) to ensure consistent results.
>
> a. Using the `rnorm()` function, create a vector, `x`, containing 100
>    observations drawn from a $N(0, 1)$ distribution. This represents a
>    feature, $X$.
>
> b. Using the `rnorm()` function, create a vector, `eps`, containing 100
>    observations drawn from a $N(0, 0.25)$ distribution---a normal
>    distribution with mean zero and variance 0.25.
>
> c. Using x and `eps`, generate a vector y according to the model
>    $$Y = -1 + 0.5X + \epsilon$$
>    What is the length of the vector `y`? What are the values of
>    $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ in this linear model?
>
> d. Create a scatterplot displaying the relationship between `x` and `y`.
>    Comment on what you observe.
>
> e. Fit a least squares linear model to predict `y` using `x`. Comment on the
>    model obtained. How do $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ compare to $\beta_0$
>    and $\beta_1$?
>
> f. Display the least squares line on the scatterplot obtained in (d). Draw the
>    population regression line on the plot, in a different color. Use the
>    `legend()` command to create an appropriate legend.
>
> g. Now fit a polynomial regression model that predicts `y` using `x` and `x^2`.
>    Is there evidence that the quadratic term improves the model fit? Explain
>    your answer.
>
> h. Repeat (a)--(f) after modifying the data generation process in such a way
>    that there is *less* noise in the data. The model (3.39) should remain the
>    same. You can do this by decreasing the variance of the normal distribution
>    used to generate the error term $\epsilon$ in (b). Describe your results.
>
> i. Repeat (a)--(f) after modifying the data generation process in such a way
>    that there is *more* noise in the data. The model (3.39) should remain the
>    same. You can do this by increasing the variance of the normal distribution
>    used to generate the error term $\epsilon$ in (b). Describe your results.
>
> j. What are the confidence intervals for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ based on the
>    original data set, the noisier data set, and the less noisy data set?
>    Comment on your results.

### Question 14

> This problem focuses on the collinearity problem.
>
> a. Perform the following commands in R :
>    
>    ```r
>    > set.seed(1)
>    > x1 <- runif(100)
>    > x2 <- 0.5 * x1 + rnorm(100) / 10
>    > y <- 2 + 2 * x1 + 0.3 * x2 + rnorm(100)
>    ```
>
>    The last line corresponds to creating a linear model in which `y` is a
>    function of `x1` and `x2`. Write out the form of the linear model. What are
>    the regression coefficients?
>
> b. What is the correlation between `x1` and `x2`? Create a scatterplot
>    displaying the relationship between the variables.
>
> c. Using this data, fit a least squares regression to predict `y` using `x1`
>    and `x2`. Describe the results obtained. What are $\hat\beta_0$,
>    $\hat\beta_1$, and $\hat\beta_2$? How do these relate to the true $\beta_0$,
>    $\beta_1$, and \beta_2$? Can you reject the null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_1$
>    = 0$? How about the null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_2 = 0$?
>
> d. Now fit a least squares regression to predict `y` using only `x1`. Comment
>    on your results. Can you reject the null hypothesis $H 0 : \beta_1 = 0$?
>
> e. Now fit a least squares regression to predict `y` using only `x2`. Comment
>    on your results. Can you reject the null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_1 = 0$?
>
> f. Do the results obtained in (c)--(e) contradict each other? Explain your
>    answer.
>
> g. Now suppose we obtain one additional observation, which was unfortunately
>    mismeasured.
>    ```r
>    > x1 <- c(x1, 0.1)
>    > x2 <- c(x2, 0.8)
>    > y <- c(y, 6)
>    ```
>    Re-fit the linear models from (c) to (e) using this new data. What effect
>    does this new observation have on the each of the models? In each model, is
>    this observation an outlier? A high-leverage point? Both? Explain your
>    answers.

### Question 15

> This problem involves the `Boston` data set, which we saw in the lab for this
> chapter. We will now try to predict per capita crime rate using the other
> variables in this data set. In other words, per capita crime rate is the
> response, and the other variables are the predictors.
>
> a. For each predictor, fit a simple linear regression model to predict the
>    response. Describe your results. In which of the models is there a
>    statistically significant association between the predictor and the
>    response? Create some plots to back up your assertions.
>
> b. Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the
>    predictors. Describe your results. For which predictors can we reject the
>    null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_j = 0$?
>
> c. How do your results from (a) compare to your results from (b)? Create a
>    plot displaying the univariate regression coefficients from (a) on the
>    $x$-axis, and the multiple regression coefficients from (b) on the
>    $y$-axis. That is, each predictor is displayed as a single point in the
>    plot. Its coefficient in a simple linear regression model is shown on the
>    x-axis, and its coefficient estimate in the multiple linear regression
>    model is shown on the y-axis.
>
> d. Is there evidence of non-linear association between any of the predictors
>    and the response? To answer this question, for each predictor X, fit a
>    model of the form 
>    $$
>    Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \epsilon
>    $$
